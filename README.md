# Dendrite Spine Identification Project

### Automating annotating dendritic spines in images using Faster Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster RCNNs) & TensorFlow Object Detection

To test the project, simply run this [notebook](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/SpineObjectDetection/blob/master/dendrite_indentification.ipynb)

For development setup, follow [these well-written instructions](https://medium.com/@daniel.schwalm/installing-the-tensorflow-object-detection-api-on-windows-10-443750faf7b8). Fair warning - it's a pain. You'll need to install many deps that pip doesn't include, mess with the PATH and PYTHONPATH, and run some generative commands.

This work is heavily based on the following projects:
